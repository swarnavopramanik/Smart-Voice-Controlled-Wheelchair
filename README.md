INTRODUCTION

People who are suffering from diseases like paralysis, polio, or from some accident and loss  of their hands and legs need some artificial source with the help of which they can move.  We are designing a wheelchair to provide extra safety features to prevent common  wheelchair accidents. The voice Recognition module will recognize the voice of the user.  The sensor will be mounted on a smart wheelchair. Batteries will power the Ultrasonic  sensors, Arduino, Bluetooth module, and driving two DC motors.
